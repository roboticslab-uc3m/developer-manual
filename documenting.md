# Documenting

## General Documenting

* The preferred way of documenting things (except [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) for C/C++) is [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) ([Markdown (Spanish)](https://asrob.uc3m.es/tutoriales/writing/markdown.html)).
* You can find plenty of general recommendations for writing at: [Redactar (Spanish)](https://asrob.uc3m.es/tutoriales/writing/redactar.html)

## If you have any doubts or comments

Please read the [Asking Questions](asking-questions.md) section, and once you've succeded with its [self-evaluation](asking-questions.md#self-evaluation-time) follow the recommendations by commenting publicly [HERE](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/developer-manual/issues/new) if required
