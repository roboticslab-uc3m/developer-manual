# Introduction

## Which Operating System should I use?

- For desktops and laptops, we recommend a GNU/Linux ([what is Linux? (Spanish)](https://asrob.uc3m.es/tutoriales/software/linux/introduction.html#%C2%BFqu%C3%A9-es-linux)) distribution ([what is a distribution? (Spanish)](https://asrob.uc3m.es/tutoriales/software/linux/introduction.html#%C2%BFqu%C3%A9-es-una-distribuci%C3%B3n-de-linux)) on a native partition ([what options do I have to install a distribution? (Spanish)](https://asrob.uc3m.es/tutoriales/software/linux/introduction.html#%C2%BFqu%C3%A9-opciones-tengo-para-instalar-una-distribuci%C3%B3n) and [how to install a native partition (Spanish)](https://asrob.uc3m.es/tutoriales/software/linux/introduction.html#%C2%BFc%C3%B3mo-instalo-una-distribuci%C3%B3n-en-una-partici%C3%B3n-nativa)). The specific GNU/Linux distribution we recommend is [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/#download) (`Ubuntu Desktop`). You are free to choose between  version `18.04 LTS ` and `20.04 LTS`. Either one is a good option, although we have slight more support for `18.04` regarding OpenRAVE simulation.

## I was told to install something. How can I do that?

- Please make sure you carefully read and understood the dedicated section at: [how do I install programs on Linux? (Spanish)](https://asrob.uc3m.es/tutoriales/software/linux/introduction.html#¿cómo-instalo-programas-en-linux)
- Each of our repositories usually contains instructions for installing, e.g. the initial `README.md` of <https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision> links to its [doc/vision-install.md](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision/blob/master/doc/vision-install.md) documentation file.
