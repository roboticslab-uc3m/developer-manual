# Asking Questions

## What should I do before asking a question?

Search for the answer! This is because the quickest answers are the ones that are already written! It's pretty possible that your question has already been answered somewhere!!

Here are some places where to look before asking a question:

* Read the Frequently Asked Questions section of this manual: [Developer Manual (FAQ)](frequently-asked-questions.md)
* Read the manuals! You can find a list of all the manuals including this one at: [Repository Index (Manuals and FAQs)](appendix/repository-index.md#manuals-and-faqs)
* Do a search among open and closed issues of the repositories associated to your project:
    1. Go to the repositories that are most related from the [Repository Index](appendix/repository-index.md)
    1. Click on the `Issues` tab, which defaults to a view on open Github Issues of the repository: see if you can find an answer among them!
    1. Click on `Closed` to see the closed Github Issues of the repository: see if you can find an answer among them!
    1. The `Filters` query changed from `is:issue is:open` to `is:issue is:closed` when you clicked on `Closed`. See if you can modify the query to find the answer you are looking for!
* We still have some information in our [old wiki](https://apps-robots.uc3m.es/robots/wiki/)
* You can also [Google](https://www.google.com) or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) it!

## I cannot find my question answered anywhere, how and where should I ask my question?

Please open a GitHub Issue following [THESE GUIDELINES ("Opening a GitHub Issue")](github.md#github-issues).

* Note: If it refers to a wiki page, add a comment in the *Discussion* tab on the wiki.

## I really don't like GitHub Issues, why can't I just bug somebody who knows the answer?

There are several reasons to prefer GitHub Issues rather than asking in person or private messaging:

* Answers are left for future people with doubts, and even the *you from the future* can run into the same issue after some time and then find the solution online!
* Developers can have more time to perform research and/or create new cool applications, maybe even that coffee-making or pizza-delivery robot you've been waiting for, yay!
* GitHub Issues have proved many times to be an efficient mechanism to receive answers from very unexpected contributors, which have provided many answers, new ideas, and worthy viewpoints!!

## Self evaluation time!
